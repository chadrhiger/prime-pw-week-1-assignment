<ul>
    <li>Chad Stanley is nickname I got when I first moved to MPLS. A social psuedonym, if you will.</li>
    <li>I replaced my last name with my middle name on FaceBook as a way to get people I didn't really know from high school to stop sending me friend requests. (lol)</li>
    <li>Since then it's become a bit of an alter-ego, somewhat akin to Raoul Duke or Sal Paradise.</li> 
    <li>(i still have yet to delve into color pallates)</li> 
    <li>(i think it's funny to make that fact painfully obvious in my progression)</li>
    <li>(i also think making the background color barely indistinguishable from plain white is "fun")
